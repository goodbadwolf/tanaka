# Tanaka

[![CI](https://github.com/goodbadwolf/tanaka/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/goodbadwolf/tanaka/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/goodbadwolf/tanaka?include_prereleases)](https://github.com/goodbadwolf/tanaka/releases)

Tanaka keeps your Firefox browsing **entangled** across every computer you use. Open a tab at work and it‚Äôs already there when you get home; close a noisy article on your laptop and it vanishes from your desktop too. Tanaka selectively mirrors _tracked_ windows so your workspace feels like a single, coherent browser‚Äîno matter how many machines you run.

> **Why ‚ÄúTanaka‚Äù?**  
> **Áî∞‰∏≠** means ‚Äúamong the fields.‚Äù Tanaka lives _between_ your devices, weaving isolated browsers into one continuous field of tabs.

## ‚ú® Features

| Capability                  | Notes                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Live mirroring**          | Tab create / move / close events propagate across devices in ~1 s (baseline poll 5 s, adaptive downwards on activity). |
| **Selective tracking**      | Opt-in per window; leave private or throw-away windows unsynced.                                                       |
| **Session resurrection**    | Browser crashed? Tanaka restores the last good state from another device.                                              |
| **Conflict-free merges**    | Uses Yjs/yrs CRDTs‚Äîorder-independent, race-free.                                                                       |
| **End-to-end encryption**   | TLS + shared token; data never travels plaintext.                                                                      |
| _(Planned)_ **Scroll sync** | Resume reading at exactly the same pixel offset.                                                                       |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack (Personal-Scale)

| Tier              | Technology                                          | Rationale                                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Extension**     | TypeScript¬†+ WebExtension API¬†+ Yjs                 | Native API support & fast dev loop.                  |
| **Tanaka server** | Rust (**axum**¬†+¬†tokio¬†+¬†yrs)                       | Async, small single binary, excellent performance.   |
| **Persistence**   | **SQLite¬†3 (WAL)** + in-memory read cache (DashMap) | Crash-safe, zero-config file DB, ultra-fast lookups. |
| **OpenAPI UI**    | **utoipa-swagger-ui** (enabled at `/swagger/`)      | FastAPI-style swagger docs out-of-the-box.           |
