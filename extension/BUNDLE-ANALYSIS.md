# Bundle Analysis Report

Generated on: January 25, 2025

## Bundle Sizes

### Entry Points

- **background.js**: 12K - Background service worker
- **popup/popup.js**: (loaded via chunks)
- **settings/settings.js**: (loaded via chunks)

### Code Split Chunks

- **201.js**: 12K - Shared utilities and components
- **450.js**: 11K - Additional shared code
- **719.js**: 24K - Largest chunk, likely contains Yjs CRDT library

### Vendor Bundles

- **vendor-preact.js**: 20K - Preact framework (optimized React alternative)
- **vendor-polyfill.js**: 9.2K - WebExtension polyfill for cross-browser compatibility

## Total Bundle Size

Approximately **88.2K** for all JavaScript bundles (minified, production build)

## Optimization Findings

### Successes

1. **Code Splitting**: Successfully split code into logical chunks
2. **Vendor Separation**: Framework code (Preact) separated from application code
3. **Small Polyfill**: WebExtension polyfill is appropriately sized at 9.2K
4. **Tree Shaking**: Enabled and working (sideEffects: false configured)
5. **Minification**: Advanced compression enabled with SWC

### Areas for Potential Improvement

1. **Chunk 719.js (24K)**: Largest chunk - investigate if this can be split further
2. **Lazy Loading**: Settings and popup apps already lazy loaded âœ“
3. **CSS Modules**: Currently showing warnings but not affecting functionality

## Performance Metrics

- Build time: ~130ms (excellent)
- Total JS size: <100KB (well within extension size limits)
- Code splitting strategy: Effective

## Recommendations

1. Monitor chunk 719.js as the codebase grows
2. Consider dynamic imports for rarely used features
3. CSS modules configuration could be optimized to remove warnings
4. Current bundle size is excellent for a WebExtension

## Conclusion

The bundle optimization is working effectively. The total size is well-optimized for a Firefox extension with CRDT synchronization capabilities.
