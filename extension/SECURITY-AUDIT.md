# Security Audit for Tanaka v0.5.0

Date: December 15, 2024

> **Note**: This is an example security audit from the v0.5.0 release. Perform a new audit when making security-related changes.

## Permissions Analysis

### Required Permissions ✅

- **tabs**: Required for tab synchronization functionality
- **storage**: Required for storing user settings and sync state
- **windows**: Required for tracking window states

### Host Permissions ⚠️

Currently limited to localhost only:

- `http://localhost/*`
- `https://localhost/*`
- `http://127.0.0.1/*`
- `https://127.0.0.1/*`

**Note**: Will need to update for production server URLs.

## Content Security Policy ✅

```
script-src 'self'; object-src 'self'
```

- No inline scripts allowed
- No external script sources
- Properly restrictive for an extension

## Security Best Practices Review

### ✅ Implemented

1. **No eval() usage**: Code uses proper TypeScript/JavaScript
2. **HTTPS enforcement**: API client checks for HTTPS in production
3. **Token storage**: Auth tokens stored in browser.storage.local
4. **Input validation**: Type guards validate all external data
5. **Error handling**: Sensitive errors are not exposed to users

### ✅ Code Patterns

- Using Result pattern for error handling
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No hardcoded credentials in source
- Environment-based configuration

### ⚠️ Recommendations for Production

1. Update host_permissions to actual server domains
2. Consider adding rate limiting for API calls
3. Implement token refresh mechanism
4. Add request signing for additional security

## Vulnerabilities Found

**None** - The extension follows security best practices for a v0.5 release.

## Conclusion

The extension is secure for its current localhost-only deployment. Before production release:

1. Update host permissions to production domains only
2. Ensure server has proper CORS headers
3. Implement token rotation
4. Consider adding request signatures

The current security posture is appropriate for v0.5.0.
