# Documentation Reorganization Summary

> Date: 2025-07-11

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Archive Directory
- Created `/docs/archive/` to store historical documentation
- Moved completed work documentation to reduce clutter in main docs

### 2. Archived Files
- **SCSS_AUDIT.md** → `archive/SCSS_AUDIT.md` (outdated after Phase 2.5 completion)
- **SCSS Migration Phases 1-2.5** → `archive/SCSS_MIGRATION_PHASES_1-2.5.md` (extracted from migration plan)

### 3. File Transformations
- **SCSS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md** → **SCSS_ROADMAP.md**
  - Removed completed phases (moved to archive)
  - Removed massive "Outstanding Tasks" section (107 tasks)
  - Focused on Phase 3 & 4 implementation
  - Reduced from 1041 lines to ~200 lines

### 4. Updated References
Updated all references to SCSS_MIGRATION_PLAN.md in:
- TODOS.md (3 references)
- DEVELOPMENT.md (1 reference)
- ARCHITECTURE.md (1 reference)
- DESIGN_SYSTEM_SPEC.md (2 references)
- PLAYGROUND.md (1 reference)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Duplication**: Tasks are now only tracked in TODOS.md
2. **Cleaner Structure**: Active docs contain only relevant information
3. **Historical Preservation**: Completed work is archived, not lost
4. **Clear Separation**: Technical reference (SCSS_ROADMAP) vs task tracking (TODOS)
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for each type of information

## Current Documentation Structure

### Active Styling Documentation
- **SCSS_ROADMAP.md** - Technical roadmap for Phase 3 & 4
- **STYLING_GUIDE.md** - Developer reference for styling patterns
- **COMPONENT_TEMPLATE.md** - Quick-start component boilerplate
- **DESIGN_SYSTEM_SPEC.md** - Future vision for design system

### Task Tracking
- **TODOS.md** - Single source of truth for all pending tasks

### Archived Documentation

- **archive/SCSS_MIGRATION_PHASES_1-2.5.md** - Completed phases documentation
