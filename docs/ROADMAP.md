# Tanaka Development Roadmap (v1.0)

This roadmap consolidates extension and server development, focusing on pending work with related changes grouped together.

## üéØ Current Status

- **Completed**: Phase 1 (UI Migration), Phase 2 (Architecture), and Phase 3 (Critical Fixes) ‚úÖ
- **Current**: Phase 4 (UI Redesign & Testing) üé®
- **Extension**: v0.5.0 with 85%+ test coverage, React/Preact UI, CRDT Web Worker, full permission management
- **Server**: Clean architecture with repositories, services, error handling, CRDT sync, complete security hardening

**üéâ MILESTONE**: All critical bugs fixed! Multi-device synchronization is fully functional. Now focusing on UI improvements and comprehensive testing.

## üåø Branch Strategy (Pending Work)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Always create feature branches with the exact names listed below. NEVER push directly to main.**

```
main
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 4: UI Redesign & Testing (CURRENT)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Phase 5: Production Ready
```

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 3: Critical Fixes (COMPLETE)

Fixed all critical bugs preventing multi-device sync (PRs #69-#80). SQLx migrations implemented. Three data integrity items deferred to Phase 5.

---

## üß™ Phase 4: UI Redesign & Testing

### Overview

Modernize the extension UI with proper design system, comprehensive testing, and improved developer experience.

### Primary Goals

1. **Code Quality**: Zero `any` types, consistent patterns, clean architecture
2. **Design System**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, design tokens, dark mode
3. **Component Library**: Reusable, tested, accessible components
4. **Testing**: 95%+ coverage, visual regression, E2E user flows
5. **Developer Experience**: Storybook, documentation, tooling

---

## üöÄ Phase 5: Production Ready

### Overview

Prepare for v1.0 release with performance optimization, monitoring, production hardening, and Mozilla addon store submission.

### Primary Goals

1. **Monitoring**: Server metrics, distributed tracing, performance dashboards
2. **Performance**: Handle 200+ tabs smoothly, optimize sync latency
3. **Production Hardening**:
   - Operation idempotency to prevent duplicates
   - Robust operation ID format
   - Full CRDT state materialization to database
4. **Release**: Mozilla addon store ready, single-binary server, v1.0 documentation

## üìù Progress Tracking Rules

- Use `[ ]` for pending, `[x]` for completed
- Update this file as part of each PR
- Each branch should result in working software
- Run all tests before marking complete
- **Always create a PR when a branch is ready for review**
- Include comprehensive testing and documentation in each PR

---

## üîë Key Principles

1. **Unified Changes**: Related extension and server changes in same branch
2. **Incremental Progress**: Each branch should be independently mergeable
3. **Test Everything**: Both sides need comprehensive tests
4. **Performance First**: Every change considers 200+ tab scenarios
5. **Clean Architecture**: Apply same patterns to both extension and server
