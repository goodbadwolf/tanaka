## üß™ Phase 5: Core Stability

### Overview

Phase 5 focuses on core stability improvements that directly impact reliability and performance. With baselines established in Phase 4, we can now measure the impact of our improvements.

This phase addresses critical technical debt in three key areas: memory management, performance optimization, and error resilience. We implement only the most essential improvements that block v1.0.

**Key Focus Areas:**

1. **Memory Management**: Fix identified leaks and implement proper cleanup
2. **Performance**: Optimize for 200+ tab scenarios with batching and caching
3. **Resilience**: Build robust error recovery and offline support

### Primary Goals

1. **Memory Management**: Fix critical leaks and implement proper cleanup
   - Fix all identified memory leaks in event handlers
   - Implement AbortController pattern for cleanup
   - Add proper disposal in destructors
   - No growing memory leaks over 24-hour usage

2. **Performance Optimization**: Handle 200+ tabs smoothly
   - Implement operation batching with deduplication
   - Optimize database indices and queries
   - Reduce network calls by 70%+ through batching
   - Target sub-100ms sync latency for P95

3. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of failures
   - Implement exponential backoff with jitter
   - Add circuit breaker for cascading failures
   - Create offline operation queue
   - Ensure recovery from extended outages

### Dependencies & Prerequisites

Before starting Phase 5, ensure:

1. **Phase 4 Complete**:
   - Baseline metrics collected and documented
   - Architecture decisions recorded
   - Operational runbook created
   - Performance budgets defined
2. **Development Environment**:
   - Node.js 24+, pnpm 10.11+, Rust 1.83+
   - SQLx CLI for database migrations
   - cargo-nextest and cargo-llvm-cov for testing
3. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Unit test framework operational
   - CI/CD pipeline running all checks
   - Pre-commit hooks installed and working
   - Benchmark suite ready

### Sub-phases

Phase 5 is organized into 3 focused sub-phases:

#### Phase 5.1: Memory & Performance
**Focus**: Fix critical memory leaks and implement performance optimizations
- Branch: `fix/memory-and-event-handling`
- Branch: `feat/operation-batching`
- Establishes stable foundation for further improvements

#### Phase 5.2: Resilience
**Focus**: Build robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Branch: `feat/error-recovery`
- Ensures application continues working under adverse conditions

#### Phase 5.3: Basic Security
**Focus**: Implement essential security measures
- Branch: `feat/input-validation`
- Basic input validation and sanitization only

### Implementation Notes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid These Anti-patterns from Analysis:**
- ‚ùå WeakMap for window tracking - would cause immediate garbage collection
- ‚ùå Token encryption with key in same storage - provides no security benefit

## üìù Progress Tracking Rules

- Use `[ ]` for pending, `[x]` for completed
- Update this file as part of each PR
- Each branch should result in working software
- Run all tests before marking complete
- **Always create a PR when a branch is ready for review**
