## üìù Progress Tracking Rules

- Use `[ ]` for pending, `[x]` for completed
- Update this file as part of each PR
- Each branch should result in working software
- Run all tests before marking complete
- **Always create a PR when a branch is ready for review**
- Include comprehensive testing and documentation in each PR

---

## üîë Key Principles

1. **Unified Changes**: Related extension and server changes in same branch
2. **Incremental Progress**: Each branch should be independently mergeable
3. **Test Everything**: Both sides need comprehensive tests
4. **Performance First**: Every change considers 200+ tab scenarios
5. **Clean Architecture**: Apply same patterns to both extension and server
